## 📝 Overview

## This project builds on **Part 1 (Linux Disk Partitioning — Creating 6 Partitions on a 20GB Disk)** and focuses on turning raw partitions into usable, managed storage. In this phase, I:

#### - Formatted new partitions with ext4
#### - Created and mounted filesystem mount points
#### - Configured **persistent mounts** using /etc/fstab
#### - Prepared selected partitions for **LVM**
#### - Created and extended a **volume group (VG)**
#### - Created and extended a **logical volume (LV)**
#### - Resized the filesystem to consume the extended space

#### This work simulates real‑world Linux system administration tasks around storage provisioning, filesystem management, and logical volume expansion.
